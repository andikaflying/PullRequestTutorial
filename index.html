    <h1>Nigeria’s Buhari extends deadline to turn in old banknotes</h1>
    <p>
      Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday gave approval to the
      central bank to extend the deadline to turn in some old banknotes until
      April 10 after cash shortages stoked anger before presidential and
      parliamentary elections later this month.

    <h1>
      Last year, Nigeria’s central bank decided to start circulating newly
      designed 1,000 ($2.17) 500 ($1.08) and 200 ($0.43) naira notes. The
      deadline to turn in old notes has already been extended once to February
      10, after which they would no longer have been legal tender.
