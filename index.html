    <h1>Nigeria’s Buhari extends deadline to turn in old banknotes</h1>
    <p>
      Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday gave approval to the central bank to extend the deadline to turn in some old banknotes until April 10 after cash shortages stoked anger before presidential and parliamentary elections
      later this month.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Last year, Nigeria’s central bank decided to start circulating newly designed 1,000 ($2.17) 500 ($1.08) and 200 ($0.43) naira notes. The deadline to turn in old notes has already been extended once to February 10, after which they
      would no longer have been legal tender.
